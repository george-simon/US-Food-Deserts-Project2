# US-Food-Deserts
## *TEAM: Paul Hardy, John Levear, Brock Vriesman, and George Simon*

## Project Summary
This project seek to share knowledge to vistors through visualizations and data insights on food deserts. The hope is to answer the following series of questions:
* What are food deserts?
* Where are food deserts located in the US?
* Who lives in food deserts?
 
After giving the visitor a brief overview of food deserts, we will guide them to explore the topic of food deserts in an urban setting close to home in Oregon. One of our goals is to illustrate to the visitor that food deserts are not limited to rural areas and may be closer to home in an urban environment (specifically Multnomah County in Oregon) than they previously thought. At this point, the questions we want to be able to communicate to the visitor the answers to the following questions and display visualizations of possible highlights of *risk factors* in Multnomah County.
* What does a food desert look like in Multnomah County (Oregon)?
* Are there any data insights of interest that exist in Multnomah County?
