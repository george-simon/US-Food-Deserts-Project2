# US-Food-Deserts-Project2

## Disheveled Mummies Project #2 Proposal
Our project will focus on food deserts. Answering a series of questions, initially, to inform visitors:
* What are food deserts?
* Where are food deserts located in the US?
* Who lives in food deserts?
 
After giving the visitor a brief overview of food deserts, we will guide them to explore the topic of food deserts in an urban setting. Our goal in this project will be to illustrate to the visitor that food deserts are not limited to rural areas and may be closer to home in an urban environment than they previously thought. At this point, the questions we want to be able to communicate to the visitor the answers to the following questions:
* What does a food desert look like in an urban setting?
* Are there income differences between food desert and non-food desert areas?
* Are there health outcome differences?
